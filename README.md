Toolset for modifying my custom fork of the eddypro-engine

* To clone with the relevant submodules:

`git clone --recurse-submodules  https://github.com/June-Skeeter/FluxCalc_engine.git`

## Setup

This is straightforward on linux.  Installing fortran on windows is more of a PITA.  It can be done, but I won't provide instruction here:

* To setup the development environment:

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get make`

`sudo apt-get install gfortran`

* To run default settings:

`bash runEPDebug.bat`
